XSS - http://127.0.0.1:8000/buy.html?<script>alert("hello");</script>
    fixed by getting rid of the word safe on line 64 of gift.html in <p>Endorsed by {{director|safe}}!</p>

CSRF - wrote csrf.html which creates a hidden form to send a gift card to the test account I specified
    I fixed this by adding @csrf_protect on line 113 in view.py and {% csrf_token %} in the form of gift.html on line 84
